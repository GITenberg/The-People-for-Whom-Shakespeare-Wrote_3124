description: 'This 1897 literary history brings to life the world of the Elizabethan
  people: their habits, clothes, food, work, and play. Includes vivid descriptions
  of dining, hawking, and family life and, of course, what people knew and thought
  about Shakespeare, his works, and the actors in his plays. This volume gives readers
  an entirely different perspective of Shakespeare.'
